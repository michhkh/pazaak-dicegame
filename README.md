# pazaak-dicegame 🎲

  This game was initially made as a basic dice game, but I became rather interested in adding a **Pazaak twist** to it.
  
  - **Pazaak** is a card game from the Star Wars universe, and _the most basic rule_ about it is you want to get as close to **20** as you can without exceeding it. 
  - The player that is the closest to **20** wins that round, if both end up with the same score then it is a tie and nobody wins that round.
  - **This Pazaak Dicegame** follows the _basic rule_. **The real Pazaak card game** has a few more rules and a lot more opportunities.
  
  Enjoy! 👨‍💻🎲
